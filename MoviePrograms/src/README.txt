To run this program all files must be downloaded. The MovieReadingProgram uses the movielist.txt file and as a result, the location of that file will be different for everyone. As
a result, the location specified in the MovieReadingProgram.java file at line 30 File file = new File(""); must be updated with the specific location where you have downloaded the
movielist.txt file. 

The other two java programs use the mymovielist.txt file and must also have the location of the file changed for your specific computer at File file = new File(""); in order to 
work.
